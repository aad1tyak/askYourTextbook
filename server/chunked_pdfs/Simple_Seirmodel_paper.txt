population with random mixing. Now 
we turn to how more complex disease 
transmission scenarios can be added to the 
model by introducing new compartments 
(groups) and more complicated flows 
between them. These will allow us to model 
important aspects such as birth, death, loss 
of immunity and age.
The basic SIR model1 has three groups:

important aspects such as birth, death, loss 
of immunity and age.
The basic SIR model1 has three groups: 
susceptible (S), infectious (I) and recovered 
(R), with a total population size N = S + 
I + R. It is parametrized by the infectious 
period 1/γ, the basic reproduction number 
R0 (the number of secondary cases for 
each infection in a completely susceptible 
population) and the contact rate β = γR0.==============================
period 1/γ, the basic reproduction number 
R0 (the number of secondary cases for 
each infection in a completely susceptible 
population) and the contact rate β = γR0.
For most infectious diseases, however, 
there is a latent period between being 
infected and becoming infectious: the 
exposed group (E). Upon being infected, 
individuals will move to this group at a 
rate βSI/N and remain there for an average ==============================
infected and becoming infectious: the 
exposed group (E). Upon being infected, 
individuals will move to this group at a 
rate βSI/N and remain there for an average 
period of 1/σ before moving into the I group. 
For many respiratory infections, immunity 
after recovery is temporary and recovered 
individuals will lose immunity and return to 
S after an average protected period of 1/ω.

after recovery is temporary and recovered 
individuals will lose immunity and return to

Demography contributes to flows in and 
out of groups. Death due to infection will 
cause a loss of individuals from the I group 
at a rate α, and all groups will experience 
background death from other causes at 
a rate µ. In otherwise stable populations, 
background deaths are balanced by births ==============================
at a rate α, and all groups will experience 
background death from other causes at 
a rate µ. In otherwise stable populations, 
background deaths are balanced by births 
into S at a rate µN.
Loss of immunity, births and deaths 
contribute to susceptible recruitment into S, 
which creates an ‘open epidemic’. Ignoring

The trajectory of I lags that of E by the 
latency period, and (when R0 > 1) both E 
and I are predicted to eventually stabilize 
at an ‘endemic equilibrium’ that depends 
on all rates in the system2 (Fig. 1b). For our

and I are predicted to eventually stabilize 
at an ‘endemic equilibrium’ that depends 
on all rates in the system2 (Fig. 1b). For our 
scenario, this occurs after about 4 years, 
when the pathogen will circulate in the 
population with E = 1.2% and I = 2.4%, 
while S = 1/R0 = 33% (Fig. 1b).

In the presence of continuous susceptible

waves (Fig. 2). The inter-epidemic interval

Increasing the latency period from  
1/σ = 7 to 14 days increases the 
inter-epidemic interval from about  
TE = 1.09 to 1.29 years, but the waves 
attenuate at roughly the same rate and  
reach approximately the same equilibrium 
of I(∞) = 2.4% (Fig. 2a). If the period of 
immunity is doubled to 1/ω = 2 years,  
the endemic equilibrium is halved to  
I(∞) = 1.2%, the inter-epidemic period ==============================
of I(∞) = 2.4% (Fig. 2a). If the period of 
immunity is doubled to 1/ω = 2 years,  
the endemic equilibrium is halved to  
I(∞) = 1.2%, the inter-epidemic period 
is increased to TE = 1.51 years, and the 
time to settle on the equilibrium increases 
substantially because the mean SEIRS loop 
duration is longer (Fig. 2c).

A useful way to understand epidemic 
waves is with ‘phase plane’ plots that  
show the trajectory of I as a function of 
S (Fig. 2b,c). In this view, the waves trace

endemic equilibrium, and this rate can be 
seen from the position of specific times on 
the spiral from the start of the first epidemic 
(for example, at the one-year mark, black 
points in Fig. 2b,c). For 1/σ = 7 days and 
1/ω = 1 year, the one-year mark on the 
trajectory (Fig. 2b, light orange) is just after 
the first trough in the wave. If we increase

this point is closer to the trough (Fig. 2b, 
medium orange). The spiral is now traced 
out more slowly, reflecting the increase in

to the phase plane (Fig. 2c). Now the spiral

Figure 3 illustrates how the SIR model 
can be extended to account for symptoms, 
multiple routes of transmission and age. For 
example, while symptoms and infectiousness 
often progress in parallel, they are not 
one and the same (Fig. 3a). Recall that the 
average rate at which an infected individual 
can infect a susceptible one (β) is a product 
of the number of contacts (k) and the 
probability of infection on contact (π)1. ==============================
average rate at which an infected individual 
can infect a susceptible one (β) is a product 
of the number of contacts (k) and the 
probability of infection on contact (π)1. 
The severity of symptoms can affect β in 
various ways: a heavy cough that expels 
more infectious particles will increase π, 
whereas a debilitating illness that reduces 
contact will decrease k. This is relevant to 
the ongoing SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, in ==============================
more infectious particles will increase π, 
whereas a debilitating illness that reduces 
contact will decrease k. This is relevant to 
the ongoing SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, in 
which the relationship between symptoms 
and infectiousness is not fully known.  
Such scenarios require that the I group  
be split into (for example) two or three  
with different groupings with repect  
to k and π (Fig. 3a).==============================

Susceptible and infectious context may
