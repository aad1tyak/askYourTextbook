ABSTRACT
While several studies on human immunodeﬁciency virus (HIV)/acquired immunodeﬁciency
syndrome (AIDS) in the homosexual and heterosexual population have demonstrated sub-
stantial advantages in controlling HIV transmission in these groups, the overall beneﬁts of the
models with a bisexual population and initiation of antiretroviral therapy have not had enough
attention in dynamic modeling. Thus, we used a mathematical model based on studying the

n the beginning of the 80’s, the Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) caught the world’s
attention because of its presentation of the acquired immunodeﬁciency syndrome (AIDS) caused by the
human immunodeﬁciency virus (HIV). The scientiﬁc community optimistically believed that an effective
vaccine would soon be developed. However, almost 40 years later, neither a vaccine nor a successful

An alternative treatment called ‘‘antiretroviral therapy’’ (ART) is currently the best option for a long-
lasting viral suppression and subsequently for a reduction of mortality. Nowadays, available drugs do not
completely eradicate the HIV infection, but they decrease virus replication and consequently reduce the
morbidity and mortality, which are generally associated with AIDS.
According to the United Nations Program on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS, 2021), since the beginning of the
epidemic and until 2019, 75.7 million people contracted HIV infection, and 32.7 million people died
from AIDS. At the end of 2019, 38 million people were living with HIV worldwide, and 1.7 million
people contracted HIV infection in that year; besides, more than 690,000 people died from AIDS-related
illnesses.

illnesses.
In 2014, UNAIDS proposed the Fast-Track Treatment target called ‘‘90-90-90 intervention,’’ in which
by 2020, it was required that 90% of individuals living with HIV infection worldwide should be diagnosed,
90% of these should have enrolled in ART, and 90% of individuals receiving ART should have a sup-
pressed viral load. In Colombia in 2019, ART coverage was 85.63%, and 72.09% had undetectable viral
load, <50 copies/mm3. The department of Narin˜o had a coverage of 90.26% of ART with 72.97% of
undetectability (CAC 2019).

One of the ﬁrst investigations in HIV/AIDS mathematical modeling was carried out by Anderson et al.
(1986) who presented two epidemiological deterministic mathematical models: the ﬁrst one is sexual
transmission in susceptible infectious people living with AIDS and noninfectious zeropositive; the second
one is sexual transmission between susceptible individuals, two classes of infectious, people living with
AIDS and, noninfectious zeropositive. Since then, a large number of variations and improvements have
been made using current mathematical and medicinal tools. These models can help predict the future
behavior of the disease and offer a better understanding of its epidemiological patterns.==============================

The following review is a list of the main articles about HIV/AIDS from 2012 to 2019: Kaur et al.
(2012), explored the spread of HIV in children, adults, and seniors taking into consideration horizontal and
vertical transmissions. Sun et al. (2013) investigated the epidemic among men who have sex with men
enrolled in public health programs such as condom use and ART, dividing the infected population
according to CD4+ cell counts in the blood. Bhunu et al. (2014) studied the dynamics of prostitution in the

according to CD4+ cell counts in the blood. Bhunu et al. (2014) studied the dynamics of prostitution in the
transmission of the disease based on an epidemiological mathematical model in susceptible infected
individuals living with AIDS, in prostitutes and nonprostitutes receiving ART and considering viral load in
the force of infection. Bhunu (2015) claimed that the care for individuals living with HIV/AIDS is more
than the provision of ART, and the homelessness on HIV/AIDS transmission is described through a
deterministic mathematical model.

The PhD thesis of Afassinou (2016) introduced a compartmental mathematical model incorporating

jectable drug users was presented by Yang et al. (2017); they studied female sex workers and senior male
clients with heterosexual transmission using an epidemiological deterministic model. Omondi et al.
(2018) also approached the dynamics in the sexually mature age group aged 15 years in a population of
susceptible and infected individuals considering CD4+ T cell counts and individuals enrolled in ART.

They considered heterosexual transmission in two age groups in Kenya; young adults aged 15–24 and
adults aged 25 and older, each population was subdivided into susceptible and infected people receiving
ART treatment.
The previous literature review shows a pattern of HIV/AIDS mathematical models, which is often
considered in a heterosexual population and a few times in heterosexuals with homosexuals separately.

However, populations consisting of heterosexuals, bisexuals, and homosexuals at the same time are not
included; it means that bisexual behavior is not studied in this mathematical modeling. Thus, we investigate
the inﬂuence of sexual intercourse among these groups on the transmission of HIV and subsequent AIDS
always under ART.
The proposed model is an original result of an extensive literary review of researches about the fol-

Thus, our model considers one of its main contributions the homosexual, heterosexual, and bisexual
contacts with different sexual preferences. Sensibility of parameters in the model was analyzed according
to the Latin Hypercube Sampling Method with the aim of knowing which ones have greater sensitiveness to
the variations on the initial conditions.

A contextualization of sexual contact and its transmission mechanisms is provided in this section, it is
provided a contextualization about sexual contact and its transmission mechanisms. Heterosexual and
homosexual contact is contemplated as the main route of HIV/AIDS contagion, and bisexual contact in
heterosexuals and homosexual individuals as another way to get infected. In this regard, the transmission
between exclusively homosexual women will not be taken into account due to the absence of the exchange
of body ﬂuids, which is the principal mechanism of sexual transmission. However, there are some cases of==============================
homosexual contact is contemplated as the main route of HIV/AIDS contagion, and bisexual contact in
heterosexuals and homosexual individuals as another way to get infected. In this regard, the transmission
between exclusively homosexual women will not be taken into account due to the absence of the exchange
of body ﬂuids, which is the principal mechanism of sexual transmission. However, there are some cases of
transmission mainly due to the exchange of sex toys, for more information, see works such as Lloyd and
May (1996), Mastro and De Vincenzi (1996), Kwakwa and Ghobrial (2003), and Chan et al. (2014).
Sexual contact between homosexual and heterosexual men is justiﬁed by Rosario et al. (2006) and
Thompson and Morgan (2008), where the authors state that: ‘‘there exist individuals that change their
sexual behavior depending on the situation or at different stages in their life. A possibly common and

Sexual contact between homosexual and heterosexual men is justiﬁed by Rosario et al. (2006) and
Thompson and Morgan (2008), where the authors state that: ‘‘there exist individuals that change their
sexual behavior depending on the situation or at different stages in their life. A possibly common and
transient example of situational sexuality is the person who self identiﬁes as heterosexual, but will sexually
interact with a member of the same sex when lacking other opportunities. Less transient but also possibly
common, a person who self identiﬁes as homosexual or lesbian (either at the time, or later) may sexually
interact with a member of the opposite sex if a same-sex relationship seems unfeasible.’’ As a result, in this
model, sexual interaction between homosexual men and heterosexual men will be assumed.
The CDC estimates that HIV rates in men having sex with men (MSM) are higher than heterosexual
contacts. In part, these differences reﬂect the fact that an individual MSM can engage in both insertive and==============================

model, sexual interaction between homosexual men and heterosexual men will be assumed.
The CDC estimates that HIV rates in men having sex with men (MSM) are higher than heterosexual
contacts. In part, these differences reﬂect the fact that an individual MSM can engage in both insertive and
receptive sexual roles (versatility), while exclusively heterosexual men and women each engage in only one
of these roles (Beloqui, 2008; Simon et al., 2008; Glick et al., 2012).

A compartmental model of HIV/AIDS is represented by a system of ordinary differential equations
(ODE) formed by observing the ﬂow of individuals from one compartment to the others. As an example,
the target population is divided into three compartments, where the number of individuals changes with
respect to time; the susceptible class S(t) comprises individuals who were not exposed to infection, the
infected class I(t) consists of infected individuals who infect others, and the class of individuals living with
AIDS A(t) involves individuals who have already developed the syndrome as a result of HIV infection. The
infection occurs due to the interaction of susceptible individuals with infected ones, and depends on the
initial hypothesis of the model.

Consequently, it is assumed that the only form of contagion among homosexuals is among themselves,
and that heterosexual people become infected due to contact with homosexual men or heterosexuals of the
opposite sex. Thus, the blue lines have only one direction, while the red line between heterosexual men and

The basic reproduction number, denoted by R0, represents the expected number of secondary cases
produced by a typically infected individual in a completely susceptible population. If R0 < 1, then one
infected individual can generate less than one new infection over the course of the infectious period;
therefore, the disease cannot grow. However, if R0 > 1, then one infected individual produces more than
one new infection, and thus, the disease invades the population and it is considered an epidemic. For

We present one main scenario and three possible additional scenarios, which, in addition to allowing a
better understanding of the dynamics of HIV infection, are a fundamental tool in the design and analysis of
public health policies. A common behavior in all scenarios is the decline of susceptible populations due to
infected people, and thus, we only present changes in infected populations.==============================

The disease-free equilibrium is deﬁned as the point at which no disease is present in the population, which
is generally represented in epidemiological models when the basic reproduction number is less than one.
Getting to this point means controlling the epidemic and eradicating the infection in the long term, which is
the main goal of every epidemiological model. As a result, the right side of Figure 4 shows the infected
population when the parameter of homosexual partners is ch = 0, and thus, Rhom
0
= 0 < 1; it follows that the
population reaches a disease-free equilibrium, and, as a consequence, the infected population is eradicated.

Background section, it was mentioned that the probability of HIV infection in homosexuals is higher than
in heterosexuals. In addition, investigations such as Cohen et al. (2011) and Del Romero et al. (2016)

tioning; furthermore, one of the most difﬁcult tasks of mathematical modeling was the model parameters.
Moreover, the proposed HIV/AIDS model tries to be as approximate as possible using real parameter values
for the behavior in San Juan de Pasto. The emphasis is not on the accuracy of the scenarios, but on the actions
that can be taken now as a result of seeing the state of the epidemic in the future; these actions can involve,
among other things, the prevention of new infections, provision of ART, and educational campaigns such as
the reduction of the number of sexual partners or use of condom for self-protection.

The model presented in this work should be treated with circumspection due to the assumptions made
surrounding the estimation of the model parameters. Nonetheless, the model provides useful insights about
the dynamics of the epidemic.

7. CONCLUSIONS
A deterministic mathematical model of nonlinear differential equations was performed to model the
dynamics of HIV/AIDS in an adult population considering sexual preferences such as the following:
exclusive homosexual men contact, contact between homosexual men and women, contact between ho-
mosexual and heterosexual men, and ﬁnally, heterosexual contact, according to scientiﬁc references that
validate these interactions. Thus, we consider three susceptible populations: homosexual men, women and
heterosexual men, and consequently infected individuals under ART and people living with AIDS.

HIV/AIDS epidemic data were collected from the Departmental Health Institute of Narin˜o (IDSN, 2019) and
the National Administrative Department of Statistics (DANE, 2019) to model HIV infection in San Juan de
Pasto, Colombia. Then, we performed numerical simulations according to Runge-Kutta’s mathematical method
of order 4, where it was possible to know the effects of manipulating the parameters corresponding to the model,
and in this way, it is expected to contribute to the design of public health policies in favor of the region.
Based on numerical simulations with city-speciﬁc parameters and considering the three different sce-
narios, it can be given three referent conclusions related to the dynamical behavior about parameters

narios, it can be given three referent conclusions related to the dynamical behavior about parameters
involved in the model. First, the number of sexual partners ch‚ hw‚ hm‚ s and the departure rate in infected
individuals a are the most sensitive parameters in the dynamics of infection because infected populations
have big changes when these values are slightly modiﬁed. Second, scenario 2 shows that the best way to
decrease heterosexual contagion in San Juan de Pasto is to increase the departure rate in infected indi-
viduals a. Third, scenarios 1 and 3 show that increasing the number of sexual partners in homosexual or

Thus, the best way to reduce contagion and consequently to reach a disease-free equilibrium is mainly
decreasing the number of homosexual partners since they are the most affected population by the virus and
the most likely to get infected and to spread the infection. Increasing the departure rate of infected
individuals leads to a decrease in infected heterosexual men and infected women, but it is not enough to
prevent and curb the rate of contagion.

increase of new HIV infections followed by a substantial decline in the generation of new infections.
